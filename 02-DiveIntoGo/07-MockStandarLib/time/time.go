package time

// A Time represents an instant in time with nanosecond precision.
//
// Programs using times should typically store and pass them as values,
// not pointers. That is, time variables and struct fields should be of
// type time.Time, not *time.Time.
//
// A Time value can be used by multiple goroutines simultaneously except
// that the methods GobDecode, UnmarshalBinary, UnmarshalJSON and
// UnmarshalText are not concurrency-safe.
//
// Time instants can be compared using the Before, After, and Equal methods.
// The Sub method subtracts two instants, producing a Duration.
// The Add method adds a Time and a Duration, producing a Time.
//
// The zero value of type Time is January 1, year 1, 00:00:00.000000000 UTC.
// As this time is unlikely to come up in practice, the IsZero method gives
// a simple way of detecting a time that has not been initialized explicitly.
//
// Each Time has associated with it a Location, consulted when computing the
// presentation form of the time, such as in the Format, Hour, and Year methods.
// The methods Local, UTC, and In return a Time with a specific location.
// Changing the location in this way changes only the presentation; it does not
// change the instant in time being denoted and therefore does not affect the
// computations described in earlier paragraphs.
//
// Representations of a Time value saved by the GobEncode, MarshalBinary,
// MarshalJSON, and MarshalText methods store the Time.Location's offset, but not
// the location name. They therefore lose information about Daylight Saving Time.
//
// In addition to the required “wall clock” reading, a Time may contain an optional
// reading of the current process's monotonic clock, to provide additional precision
// for comparison or subtraction.
// See the “Monotonic Clocks” section in the package documentation for details.
//
// Note that the Go == operator compares not just the time instant but also the
// Location and the monotonic clock reading. Therefore, Time values should not
// be used as map or database keys without first guaranteeing that the
// identical Location has been set for all values, which can be achieved
// through use of the UTC or Local method, and that the monotonic clock reading
// has been stripped by setting t = t.Round(0). In general, prefer t.Equal(u)
// to t == u, since t.Equal uses the most accurate comparison available and
// correctly handles the case when only one of its arguments has a monotonic
// clock reading.
//
