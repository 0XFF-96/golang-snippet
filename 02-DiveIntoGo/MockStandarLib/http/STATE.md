### Stateful machine
 
// A ConnState represents the state of a client connection to a server.
// It's used by the optional Server.ConnState hook.
type ConnState int

const (
	// StateNew represents a new connection that is expected to
	// send a request immediately. Connections begin at this
	// state and then transition to either StateActive or
	// StateClosed.
	StateNew ConnState = iota

	// StateActive represents a connection that has read 1 or more
	// bytes of a request. The Server.ConnState hook for
	// StateActive fires before the request has entered a handler
	// and doesn't fire again until the request has been
	// handled. After the request is handled, the state
	// transitions to StateClosed, StateHijacked, or StateIdle.
	// For HTTP/2, StateActive fires on the transition from zero
	// to one active request, and only transitions away once all
	// active requests are complete. That means that ConnState
	// cannot be used to do per-request work; ConnState only notes
	// the overall state of the connection.
	StateActive

	// StateIdle represents a connection that has finished
	// handling a request and is in the keep-alive state, waiting
	// for a new request. Connections transition from StateIdle
	// to either StateActive or StateClosed.
	StateIdle

	// StateHijacked represents a hijacked connection.
	// This is a terminal state. It does not transition to StateClosed.
	StateHijacked

	// StateClosed represents a closed connection.
	// This is a terminal state. Hijacked connections do not
	// transition to StateClosed.
	StateClosed
